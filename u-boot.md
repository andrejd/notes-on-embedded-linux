## U-Boot, the Universal Bootloader

U-Boot takes place in the embedded Linux system as a third stage bootloader. It is responsible of configuring main interfaces and launching a Linux system. Note however that it is possible to avoid this step and to directly boot Linux from AT91Bootstrap, in a production phase for instance.

>Latest versions of U-Boot supports loading Device Tree Binary (DTB), which describes the hardware in a binary file, and compressed kernel image, zImage, a compressed version of the Linux kernel image that is self-extracting.

U-Boot natively supports loading kernel as uImage, an image file that has a U-Boot wrapper that includes the OS type and loader information. uImage is created by the mkimage utility that comes in source code with U-Boot distribution and it is built during U-Boot compilation (u-boot-source-dir/tools/mkimage).

A very common practice (e.g. the typical Linux kernel Makefile) is to use a zImage file. Since a zImage file is self-extracting, therefore needs no external decompressors.

#### U-Boot environment

The U-Boot environment is a little read/write persistent space that stores variables needed by the bootloader to configure itself properly and to adapt to its environment (network configuration, boot arguments, storage location, etc.). It is located in the same media that it has booted from.

> U-Boot will try to read environment variables from NAND and in case there are none, it will use default values defined at compile time.

> U-Boot environment is flashed at the same time as Linux kernel and DTB and it is generated by SAM_BA flashing script on the fly to account for kernel and DTB image size. See chapter on SAM-BA scripts for example.


#### Basic U-Boot usage

U-Boot can be used among other things also to supply Linux kernel with custom command line which can be helpful to change kernel behavior without recompilation.

Some useful U-Boot commands:

- `printenv`: displays current environment variables, you can see cmd line that will be passed to kernel
- `setenv`: sets new env variables; not stored in flash and they will be lost upon reboot, you can save them with `saveenv` command
- `saveenv`: save environment variables to persistent storage
- `editenv`: edit existing variable
- `bootdelay`: time before loading kernel
- ...


### Build U-Boot for AcmeSystems Acqua SoM

Get source code for U-Boot from official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot). Once there, download `.zip` version of specific tag, e.g. `2015.04` or clone whole repository to your computer and checkout specific tag.

U-Boot source tree has to be patched for Acqua SoM. Patch will add needed `_defconfig` files and support for reading MAC address and SERIAL NUMBER from on board eeprom. Patch file can be downloaded from [Final patch to support Acqua on u-boot](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/acmesystems/tYwnNBkogJ0) thread on AcmeSystems Google Groups group.

```bash
# first unzip downloaded archive
unzip u-boot-2015.04.zip

# go into newly created directory
cd u-boot-2015.04

# download patch file for AcmeSystems Acqua SoM
wget https://groups.google.com/group/acmesystems/attach/ac9d4bdf3c4ff053/final_support_acqua_on_uboot.patch

# patch U-Boot source tree
patch -p1 <  final_support_acqua_on_uboot.patch

# load initial configuration (created by patch in configs/ directory)
make acqua_nandflash_defconfig

# change settings, e.g. enable network support
make menuconfig

# save current configuration to defconfig file (optional, see make help for more information)
# defconfig file can be copied to /configs directory for later use
make savedefconfig

# compile u-boot sources, image u-boot.bin will be created in the root of source tree
make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi-
```

Configuration for loading kernel from NAND flash, with added network support
```java
CONFIG_ARM=y
CONFIG_ARCH_AT91=y
CONFIG_TARGET_ACME_ACQUA=y
CONFIG_SYS_EXTRA_OPTIONS="SAMA5D3,SYS_USE_NANDFLASH"
CONFIG_NET=y
```

### U-Boot and watchdog

U-Boot has in source tree support for watchdogs (`drivers/watchdog/`) where are located drivers for different platforms. Atmel IC's related driver is found in file `at91sam9_wdt.c`.
Watchdog is not enabled by default, you need to modify configuration header file for your board located in `include/configs/` directory of U-Boot source tree.

To enable watchdog for Acme Acqua SoM, one has to modify file `acqua.h` file in `include/configs` directory by adding two defines and recompile source tree to get new binaries:
```c
#define CONFIG_HW_WATCHDOG
#define CONFIG_AT91SAM9_WATCHDOG
```

> If watchdog has already been configured before, e.g. in AT91Bootstrap, you also need to modify `at91sam9_wdt.c` file by commenting out
> watchdog initialization code, as for security reasons watchdog on Atmel IC's can be configured only once.

> With Watchdog enabled and SPL option checked in U-Boot configuration compilation of SPL bootloader will fail.  As we do not need SPL, we can disable it in U-Boot settings.

>*"The point with an SPL is to create a very small preloader, which loads the 'full' U-Boot image. It’s built from U-Boot’s sources, but with a minimal set of code. So when U-Boot is built for a platform that requires SPL, it’s typically done twice: Once for generating the SPL, and a second time for the full U-Boot. The SPL build is done with the CONFIG\_SPL defined. Only the pre-location phase runs on SPL builds. All it does is the minimal set of initializations, then loads the full U-Boot image, and passes control to it."*
