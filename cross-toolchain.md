## Cross toolchain for embedded Linux systems
 


Under Buildroot you have option to use toolchain generated by Buildroot or you can use some from other vendors. In latter case cross toolchain is downloaded from internet and installed in buildroot, which means that there is no need to recompile toolchain after `make clean` which saves a lot of time.


TODO: where toolchain is downloaded and how do we use it ...
